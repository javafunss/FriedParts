[LIMITS] 
    [a.] Only ONE of these is allowed per web page (including all tabs/frames)
    [b.] The host page must use the FriedParts master page (because it includes jQuery! duh)

[1.] Include the ASP code in your web page (.aspx file)

<!--#include file="/friedparts/fp_code/controls/parttypeaccordioncontrol/PartTypeAccordion.aspx"-->

[2.] Add the assembly references (if you don't already have them for other reasons) to the TOP of your web page (.aspx file)

<%@ Register Assembly="DevExpress.Web.ASPxGridView.v10.2, Version=10.2.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b88d1754d700e49a"
    Namespace="DevExpress.Web.ASPxGridView" TagPrefix="dxwgv" %>

[3.] Add the include to the <head>

<!--#include file="/friedparts/fp_code/controls/parttypeaccordioncontrol/PartTypeAccordion.head"-->

----------
[1.] Instantiate and keep track of (in session state) the PartTypeAccordionControl
[2.] Call PartTypeAccordionControl.Init(Me) in the Page.load() event on initialization (Not IsCallback AND Not IsPostback then...)
[3.] User Action is available as SelectedPartTypeID.Value
